Course Description:

Using computers in research computing requires a diverse set of skills and tools for the research to be effective and efficient.  The goal of this practical six-week intersession course is to increase your level of proficiency with using computers to do research in science.  

Computing in research often gets applied with one of two approaches.  Some researchers develop new code and have to consider the technical details of numerical analysis and software engineering.  Other researchers use proven applications that provide a predefined user interface and have established work flows.  This course sits at the interface between those approaches and will cover how to build new programs from other software and libraries.  It will also develop automation of research work flows for passing data between different software applications.
